Bran and his older sister Arya come from the same house. Bran loves candy very much, so Arya is going to give him some.

Arya and Bran initially have 0 candies. On the i-th of the next n days, Arya will find ai candies in the box that the Many-Faced God will give her. Every day she can give Bran no more than 8 candies. If she doesn't give the candies that day, they stay with her and she can give them back later.

Your task is to find the minimum number of days it will take Arya to give Bran k candies before the end of the nth day. Formally, you need to print the minimum number of the day by the end of which k candies will be issued (days are numbered from 1 to n).

Print -1 if it is impossible to give k candies in the given n days.

Input data
The first line contains 2 integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10000).

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, a3, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100).

Output
If Arya cannot give Bran k candies in n days, print -1.

Otherwise, print one integer — the minimum number of days it will take Arya to give Bran k candies before the end of the nth day.
