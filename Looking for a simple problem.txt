When starting the next championship, Codeforces coordinators always try to make the first task as simple as possible. This time the coordinator chose a certain task and asked n people if it was simple enough. Each person answered that the task was easy or that the task was difficult.

If at least one of these n people answered that the task is difficult, it needs to be replaced, otherwise it is not necessary. Based on these answers, determine whether the task needs to be replaced.

Input data
The first line contains one integer n (1≤n≤100) — the number of people surveyed.

The second line contains n integers, each of which is equal to either 0 or 1—the answers of the respondents. If the i-th number is 0, then the i-th person considers the task easy, and if it is equal to 1, then the i-th person considers the task difficult.

Output
Print one word: “EASY”, if the task is considered easy by all respondents, or “HARD”, if at least one respondent considers the task difficult.

You can display each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase): “EASY”, “easy”, “EaSY” and “eAsY” will be recognized correctly.
